# Proposal

## Basic Idea

User provides a word and my application provides a route (series of waypoints in order) that spells out that word.  Google has already done something similar here: http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/02/write-your-valentines-day-messages-in.html

## API's:
Google Maps

## MVP:
1) Access the google API and produce a map that has two way points.
    It will store this data in a database. It will have tests and be deployed on Heroku.
2) Add other shapes like a vertical line and a box.
3) Add OAuth for Google+
4) Add shapes for every letter
5) Add support for parsing a string and finding each letter's shape in waypoints
6) Add a way to allow the user to save their maps
7) Add a way for the user to save their maps
