IDEAS:

Expand this app:

  -Challenges:
    -API key
    -Limit of 8 waypoints per route so I would have to either make each route

-Add integration with Twitter
  -Someone logs in with their twitter account and it takes their most recent tweet, writes the content to the map, and tweets it out for them

-Add some nice styling :(
